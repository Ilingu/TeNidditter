# What I learn form this project

At begining, I thought that was a great idea to implement a "sub-like" system to teddit/nitter without realising that they already implemented it -\_- ... after that I discover other website (e.g: libreddit.com) which were doing the same thing but better (like rust based api with templating, better UI...) and I bagan to feel tired of this project because I was begining to spend to much time on it [for nothing]. But after a second thought I think this was an overall great experience because I was able to build something quite complex, and I learn so much about Golang,TS,Websocket,Svelte better project/file structure better use of http protocol, animation (canvas api)...; and it's by building that we learn so even if it was a so-so idea I enjoy building it. But yea I feel alleviate to be able to move on to another project.
